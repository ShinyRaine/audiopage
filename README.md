## Tech

The whole project is based on React.

No state management needed since we don't have a lot of components. Passing props is enough for the assignment.

I think build tool chain configuration and customization is not important part of the assignment, so pick "Create React App" to make sure we can focus on the logic part.

Pick MUI as main component library.

Using style object to make the styling solution simple.

No error hanlding since we only have one demo API.

## Build
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts
-  `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

- `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
